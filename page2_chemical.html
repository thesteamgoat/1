<p>Some forms of energy are stored such as chemical energy. Chemical energy is the
energy stored in chemical bonds. For example, the
energy stored in the sugar made by
plants is chemical energy. Plants use
the energy in the sugar to grow and live.
Chemical energy is the energy an animal
gets from food. When animals eat plants they
get the energy stored in the plants.
When animals eat other animals they get the
chemical energy stored in the animals
they eat. All this chemical energy originally
came from the sun.</p>

<p>Fossil fuels also have chemical energy. Fossil fuels have energy from the fossilized
remains of organisms. Fossil fuels formed from the decaying remains of plants
and animals that lived millions of years ago. Ancient
plants absorbed sunlight which was
stored in the plants as chemical energy. When
animals ate the plants, some of the chemical energy
was stored inside the bodies of the animals. When
ancient plants and animals died, their decaying
remains were often covered by soil. Over time, the
plant and animal remains, along with soil, formed
layers. Over millions of years, the particles of sand
and soil were compressed and compacted. The remains of the plants and animals were
stuck in the solid rock and became fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Heat and pressure changed the remains into
fossil fuels, such as oil, coal, and natural gas. When fossil
fuels are burned, the chemical energy in fossil
fuels changes to heat energy. Heat energy is used for such things as heating
buildings and cooking food. Heat energy from burning fossil fuels is also used
to make electricity at power plants. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources which are natural resources that will eventually be used up and can never be replaced. Once
these resources are used up, there will be none left.</p>
