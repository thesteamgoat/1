<p>Sound travels in waves similar to light. However, unlike light sound can only travel through matter. It cannot travel
through a vacuum as light can. Thus, sound cannot travel through outer space.
Sound is energy that can be heard and is made by vibrating objects. Sound
travels outward in all directions in waves, just llike light. Sound moves by
bumping into particles, which is what creates the vibrations. When sound travels
through an open space, it can be heard loud and clear. When it is blocked by
something, such as a pillow, it is muffled and much quieter.</p>

<p>You make sound when you speak. The vocal chords inside your neck
vibrate. These vibrations make particles of matter in the air around the vocal
chords vibrate. The vibrating particles bump against more particles, causing
them to vibrate. We hear sounds when the vibrating particles hit our eardrums and our eardrums vibrate. These vibrations turn into signals to our brains which
recognize the signals as certain sounds.</p>

<p>Sound can travel through different types of matter. Sound travels at
different speeds through different types of matter. For example, sound travels
much faster through water than through air. This is because there are more
particles of matter in water than there are in air. A gallon of water has more
particles than the same volume of air. Sound travels even faster through solids,
such as wood and iron. There are different types of sounds. This is because sound waves form
patterns. Different patterns in the air make different sounds. Some sounds are
loud, and some are soft. Some sounds are high, and some are low. No matter
how our brains recognize the patterns, all sounds are made by vibrations.</p>
