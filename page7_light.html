<p>Light is energy that travels in waves and can move through
empty space. It can be seen. It is produced by vibrating particles with an
electric charge. Light is sometimes used to determine how far away something is
in space because it is the only form of energy that can travel through a vacuum,
like outer space. Electricity transforms to light in light bulbs. Other sources of light
energy include fire and the sun.</p>

<p>Light travels in a straight line. However, that line can be changed in
different ways. For example, a flashlight can be pointed at a wall. If a mirror is
placed in the way of the flashlight's beam, then the light will not continue straight
to the wall. It will reflect back toward the direction of the flashlight. Reflection is
the bouncing back of light waves off of a surface. Shiny surfaces such as mirrors are able to bounce light off of them
more than dull surfaces.</p>

<p>Another way that light can be changed from a straight line is by refraction.
Refraction is the bending of light waves as they travel from one surface to
another. Light bends because it travels at different speeds through different
types of matter. When light travels from outer space into the air around Earth, it
bends because light travels more slowly through air than
outer space. When light travels from air into water, it also
bends because its speed changes. A way to see light refraction is to place an object,
such as a straw or pencil, in a glass of water. The object
looks bent or broken when viewed through the water.</p>
