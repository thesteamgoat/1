<p>A very common form of energy discussed on this website is electrical energy. Electrical energy is
energy made by electric charges. Electrical energy is also called electricity.
Electricity is used to heat homes and power lights, radios, and many other
devices. Electrical energy is made in different ways. Solar energy can be
absorbed by solar panels which transform solar energy into electrical
energy. Solar energy is not the only way to make electrical charges. Some other
ways to make electricity include using wind energy, burning fossil fuels, and
hydroelectric dams.</p>

<p>Sometimes, particles with charges move in a current. A current is the
movement or flow of electricity in a certain path. The path through which an
electric current moves is called a circuit. There are two types of circuits,
closed circuits and open circuits. An open circuit is a loop with a break or a gap. The gap stops
the flow of the electric current. If the circuit is open, then there is not a complete
path, and the electric current cannot travel through. An electrical circuit must be
closed to allow the current to flow through it. A closed circuit is a loop in which
all parts are connected. If the circuit is closed, then there is a complete path, and
electricity is able to travel through. For example; a light bulb will not turn on if
it does not have a complete closed circuit for the electrical energy to travel
through.</p>
